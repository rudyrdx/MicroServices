# MicroServices
 
In this project I have shown and Implemented and example where I have implemented 2 Api servers 
1 created in Nodejs and other created in Python.

Each project has a docker file that takes care of setting the envirement and running each server.

The Nodejs server is Responsive for the following:
- Authenticaion

The Python server is responsive for the following:
- Authenticated requests

This example Demonstrates that you can Divide your project Idea or Application into Multiple Microservices (like in this case 2 Microservices) and each Microservice can be written in different languages and can be run on different servers (in this case Docker). 

## This is a Chat Bot Project, Here after the Authentication, Users can converse with the chat bot, Select the Bot version and get the response from the Bot.

### TODO LISTS:
- [x] Create a Nodejs Server
- [x] Create a Python Server
- [x] Create a Docker file for each server
- [ ] Databse Integration
