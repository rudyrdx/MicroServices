# MicroServices
 
In this project I have shown and Implemented and example where I have implemented 2 Api servers 
1 created in Nodejs and other created in Python.

Each project has a docker file that takes care of setting the envirement and running each server.

The Nodejs server is Responsive for the following:
- Authenticaion

The Python server is responsive for the following:
- Authenticated requests

This example Demonstrates that you can Divide your project Idea or Application into Multiple Microservices (like in this case 2 Microservices) and each Microservice can be written in different languages and can be run on different servers (in this case Docker).
